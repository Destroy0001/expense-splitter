This is a basic responsive expense-splitter app 
to start with this you need to clone the repo and then do an `npm install`

This is dependent on an api, which is also present in the github account. 
to use the api, you need to setup the `.env` file, 
the base route to your api should be set in `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` variable.

The routes present in the app are 
`/login` ( The login page of the application)
`/registration` (The registration page of the application)
`/dashboard` ( The main app itself)
